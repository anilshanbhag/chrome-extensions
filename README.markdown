Voice In
---------
Voice In extension adds the voice input facility to all input fields . 

It is a barebones simple stripped down version of the many voice enabling on input fields extensions .

Secure Pass
-----------
Secure Pass extension generates a secure password [40 digit] for your given password. You can set the password for your accounts as this new secure password . The extension provides for storing upto 4 different passwords. 

Any time while using you may just copy paste this password from the extension popup. The secure password is displayed with overflow enabled meaning only 20digits are displayed at a time. This prevents people from peeping over your back.
